I have created 3 websites based on HTML CSS and JavaScript.

1st task represents a basic survey form which takes information from user and stores it in an excel file.

2nd task represents a responsive webpage which utilizes the function of a basic captcha which changes after every refresh.

3rd task is a very complex one. It is a clone of the Netflix Indian Home Page which is an exact copy of the home page. It has several lines of code and involves modification of text, pics, forms, buttons, header, footer, etc.

Hope you like my work :)
